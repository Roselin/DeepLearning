In this assignment, I have implemented LeNet-5 (CNN) to run the MNIST and CIFAR-100 datasets. 

## Test_img2num.py - Compare the results with previous homework
I have run from epoch 1 to 10.
In the previous assignment (without convolution), the error rate is from 0.12 ~ 0.06. (epoch 1 ~ epoch 10)
In this assignment, the error rate is from 0.018 ~ 0.008. (epoch 1 ~ epoch 10)
With convolution, the error is 10 time lower than the neural network without convolution.

In the previous assignment, the consuming time is from 10 to 100 sec.
In this assignment, the consuming time is from 100 to 800 sec.
With convolution, the consuming time is about 10 time more than the neural network without convolution.
